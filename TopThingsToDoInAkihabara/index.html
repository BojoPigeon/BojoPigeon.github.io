      <h1> Top 100+ things to do in Akihabara</h1>
      <p>I consider Akihabara to be my "Home Town in Japan" and visit
        there every one to two years. There are a lot of Akihabara guides
        on the Internet, and while there are many good ones, there are also many that 
        are either superficial or predictable. I decided to write down my top
        suggestions, originally just off the top of my head, based on the
        things I actually enjoy doing. Most of these are not things I
        would schedule or plan for, but just do spontaneously while I'm in
        the neighborhood. Many of them are also not necessarily unique to Akihabara,
        or even Tokyo.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I would not consider this list to be complete, since there are
        lots of things to do in Akihabara that don't fall under my
        interests.&nbsp; Among these would be: bars, cosplay shops,
        pachinko, karaoke, adult goods shops, animal cafes, and love
        hotels/rental rooms.<br>

        <h3>Maid Cafe JAM Akihabara</h3>
        <p>Maid cafes can generally be divided into three broad categories:
          classic, moe, and girls bar.&nbsp; JAM is one of the oldest
          classic style maid cafe. They staff wear a maid style uniform, but
          they operate like a normal cafe, with a daily special and
          occasional collaborations. Their prices are reasonable and they
          don't have an entrance fee.<br>

          hung up <i>ema</i> prayer board with their wishes on them, and
          since it's near Akihabara, they often have artistic manga-style

        <h3>Creepy Vending Machine Corner</h3>
        <p>In Kanda Sudacho, near the old Niku-no-Mansei building, is an old
          building with a lot of very strange vending machines in it. It also has
          a lot of signs posted with strange messages, including various
          warnings against people who litter or vandalize the
          location.&nbsp; In the old days the building still had a sign
          reading "Takumi Lining Shop", so it was clearly once part of the
          button and lining district in that area. In addition to an odd
          variety of items in the vending machines, there are also
          "emergency food kits" wrapped in paper with odd, disturbing short
          stories printed on the outside.&nbsp; Be aware that if you buy
          these, you're buying the stories, as the items on the inside are
          generally just cheap snacks.&nbsp; This is more of a place to go
          to contemplate the mystery than to do a lot of shopping. But some
          of the unique items would make interesting souvenirs.<br>

        <h3>Walk along Chuo-Dori</h3>
        <p>This is the main street running north-south in the Akihabara
          area.&nbsp; Along this route are numerous restaurants, cafes,
          retail shops, souvenir shops, etc.&nbsp; You'll see lots of people
          dressed up and handing out fliers or holding up placards
          encouraging people to visit bars and restaurants - but be cautions
          about any place that uses touts to get customers.&nbsp; On Sundays
          the section of the Chuo-Dori in Akihabara closes to vehicle
          traffic to allow full access to pedestrians.&nbsp; But, be sure to
          get off the main street and explore the side streets as well.<br>

        <h3>Cutie Relax - Maid Reflexology</h3>
        <p>After walking around Tokyo for a while you may have sore feet or
          a sore back.&nbsp; There are various massage and reflexology
          places in the are, but the one I recommend is Cutie Relax, which I
          have been to several times now.&nbsp; There are also a few places
          that present a less wholesome aesthetic, so do some research before going 
          into a random massage or reflexology shop.<br>

          maid outfits (and other cosplay) advertising their shops. There
          are also many popular retail shops along this road, such as
          Kotobukiya, Akibaoo, MaiDreamin, Super Potato, and the Akiba

        <p>The heyday of live street performers in Akihabara was the mid
          2000s, where you could find both amateur musicians and known
          performers of anime and game music performing their songs in front of
          Yodobashi Camera near Akihabara station. Eventually they cracked
          down on street performances in the Akihabara area.&nbsp; But you

        <h3>Nihonbashi cruise - Kanagawa River Cruise</h3>
        <p>For a different view of Akihabara, try taking a cruise along the Kanda River.
          You'll get a view of Mansebashi and the Shoheibashi, Yanagimori Shrine, and various
          buildings and train lines.  There are several ways to cruise the river, but
          I took a cruise with Nihonbashi Cruise, which cruises along the Kanda River 
          the Sumida River.  Tours are in Japanese, but the view is the same even if you
          don't understand Japanese. Reservations can be made online or on the day of the
          tour if seats are still available.

        <p>Hanei-dō is a long time bento lunch box shop that lasted through many of
          the changes the area has seen, and its history predates the booming 
          shopping district of Akihabara. In fact the sign on the shop, 
          御生菓子 繁栄堂 (<i>Onamagashi Haneido</i>) means "Fresh sweets - Haneido", 
          from the early days
          when it produced traditional Japanese confections. Open just for
          lunch on weekdays, a limited number of bento boxes are produced
          each day. There are photos and articles inside that relate the
          history of the shop.<br>

        <p>
          In Akihabara, There Is No Problem Even If a Maid From Another World Serves You! 
          (アキバなら異世界メイドがお給仕したって問題ないよねっ！) is the closest maid cafe to Akihabara
          Station, yet somehow usually stays under the radar, with several locations of "Maidreamin"
          right nearby with cheerful touts and music playing. Add the irregular hours, and
          it's an easy location to overlook. In Akihabara, There Is No Problem Even If a 
          Maid From Another World Serves You! is run by the same maid group as Zettai Ryōiki,
          so it leans into the "Moe" style motif. While Zettai Ryōiki requires you to wear
          cat ears on your first visit, In Akihabara, There Is No Problem Even If a Maid
          From Another World Serves You! gives you bunny ears.  It's worth the trip up the steep
          stairwell of the Akihabara Dempa Hall Building to visit.

        <h3>Nadai Fujisoba</h3>
        <p>A 24 hour soba noodle shop that's a great place for a late night
          meal. Often the first place I go to eat after arriving in Japan.
          There are lots of options for toppings and sides. You order via
          the vending machine at the front of the store. The ordering system
          has gotten even easier lately: you used to get a ticket that you
          took to the cook inside, but now the order goes directly to the
          kitchen so you just have to watch for your number.&nbsp; Customers
          help keep the place running smoothly by getting their own water,
          returning their dishes to the tray return, and wiping down their
          space with the damp cloths when they are finished.<br>

        <p>On the west side of the UDX Building are a series of wide steps 
          where people sit and rest or eat lunch. This location has become known

          named after the famous river bank in Kyoto where people sit and enjoy

          couples sitting together, in Akihabara, it's nearly all single people.

          more of a mom and pop feel, serving hand-made sandwiches and onigiri.</p>
        <p>Since it's near the Yamazaki headquarters, there are multiple Daily Yamazaki
          businesses within a small area, forming the <i>Yamazaki Triangle</i>.

          formal atmosphere that other maid massage places. The prices are still fairly reasonable. 
          However, English language support is a bit more limited, so knowing a bit of Japanese is 
          recommended.

        <h3>Gansen</h3>
        <p>Gansen (中華料理 雁川) is a long time local Japanese-style Chinese restaurant in Akihabara.
          It's popular with local businessmen so you might run into a bit of a crowd if you go there
          right at the lunch rush. All the tables are big with shared seating so you can expect to
          share a table with locals when you're there.

        <h3>Visit the Birthplace of the Maid Cafe</h3>
        <p>Back in 1999, what is now the MN building was one of several Gamer's buildings, and
          the 6th floor was an event space.  From July to September of 1999 there was a maid cafe
          event there in collaboration with the PC Game, <i>Welcome to Pia Carrot</i>. 
          There was another, later Pia Carrot Cafe event, followed by other Gamer's Cafe events
          and a COSPA Cafe. Finally, in March 2001, <a href="https://www.curemaid.jp/">Cure 
            Maid Cafe</a> opened in the same location, until it moved to its current location
          in the Onoden building.
        </p>
        <p>I'm not sure who the current occupant of the 6th floor is, but last I checked it was
          an art gallery with NSFW artwork, so proceed at your own risk if you try to go to the 
          6th floor itself.  These days the building is best know for Gachapon Hall on the ground
          floor.</p>

          cautious about any place with aggressive touts.
        </p>
        <p>Lately there has been experiments with closing down Junk Street

        <h3>Find Illustrated Metal Shutters</h3>
        <p>An interesting feature in Japan is the &quot;disappearing&quot;
          businesses. When closed, the entrance is covered in a metal security shutter, 
          and you'd never even know there was a business there. However
          some businesses will paint a decorative logo on the metal shutter,
          which you can only see when the businesses is closed. While Akihabara does
          not have the extensive collection of decorative shutters like you see
          in Asakusa, there are a still a few that you might find to be worth checking
          out.

          Video and Book Dream. This mysterious shop with the bright yellow sign doesn't seem 
          to have been open in years. The only information about it online is blog posts
          pointing out that it never seems to have had a web presence, and no one seems to remember
          having ever shopped there. There isn't even a visible entrance. And yet, there
          are often bicycles parked out front and a light on in the upper floor in the evening.

          is that it is &quot;doll-friendly&quot;. Ball-jointed doll collectors visit

          and tourism, at night it can be fairly quiet compared to areas of
          Tokyo associated with night life. Most of the retail
          establishments will close around 8:00 pm, so most of the shoppers
          will be gone by that time.&nbsp; When the last train leaves the
          station around midnight the area becomes even quieter, since there
          are only a few late night bars that are open between midnight and
          5:00am when trains start up again.<br>

        <p>While it's fairly well known that mAAch eCute is located in the 
          remains of the former Manseibashi Station for the JR line, the 
          Manseibashi Ginza Line Subway Station (銀座線萬世橋駅) is far less well known.
          It was a temporary station that was open from 1930-1931 with a 
          wooden deck for a platform while the excavations to get the tunnel
          past the Kanda river to reach Kanda Station was being completed. 
          All that remains now is a grate in front of Onden that acts as a 
          ventilation shaft and emergency exit for the Ginza Line, with a staircase
          hidden below.

        <h3>Collect fliers as souvenirs</h3>
        <p>Although there are not as many people handing out colorful fliers
          anymore, I used to have fun seeing how many of the leaflets I could 
          collect. These days you are more likely to see people holding up small signs -
          probably due to a change in local ordinances. Also with the
          fliers, you can check out the places online before you go, to see
          if their pricing system is too expensive or too complicated.<br>

      <h2>Sorry You Missed It</h2>
      <p>For better or worse, Akihabara has always been a place where there is a
        lot of turnover, and sometimes even long-established businesses close. 
        The locations below were formerly on my list but have since closed.</p>

      <div class="location-card">
        <h3><strike>Mister Donut</strike> <b>CLOSED</b></h3>
        <p>The Chuo Dori Mister Donut is a popular spot to stop by for
          donuts.
        </p>
        <p>Sadly, this shop closed at the end of October, 2024.</p>

        <h3><strike>Siddique</strike> <b>CLOSED</b></h3>
        <p>Siddique was a Pakistani restaurant in the southern part of the
          Akihabara area, with tasty food and generous portions. Unfortunately they
          closed in 2025. A new curry restaurant, Akiba Bistro Blue Sky, has opened in the same 
          location.

        <h3><strike>Little TGV</strike> <b>CLOSED</b></h3>
        <p>A train-themed Cosplay Cafe and Izakaya with a model railway set
          and other train memorabilia. Their menu is more extensive and
          sophisticated than the usual maid cafe in the area.&nbsp;
          Additionally, the clientele seems to be a bit different, with more
          older customers, and more families with children.&nbsp; This is
          one of the older, more established theme cafes in Akihabara -
          their blog page has entries dating back to 2009.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Sadly, Little TGV is closed as of the end of August, 2025</p>
