    <h1> Top 100+ things to do in Akihabara</h1>
    <p>I consider Akihabara to be my "Home Town in Japan" and visit
      there every one to two years. There are a lot of Akihabara guides
      on the Internet, and while there are many good ones, there are also many that 
      are either superficial or predictable. I decide to write down my top
      suggestions, originally just off the top of my head, based on the
      things I actually enjoy doing. Most of these are not things I
      would schedule or plan for, but just do spontaneously while I'm in
      the neighborhood. Many of them are also not necessarily unique to Akihabara,
      or even Tokyo.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I would not consider this list to be complete, since there are
      lots of things to do in Akihabara that don't fall under my
      interests.&nbsp; Among these would be: bars, cosplay shops,
      pachinko, karaoke, adult goods shops, animal cafes, and love
      hotels/rental rooms.<br>

      <h3>Maid Cafe JAM Akihabara</h3>
      <p>Maid cafes can generally be divided into three broad categories:
        classic, moe, and girls bar.&nbsp; JAM is one of the oldest
        classic style maid cafe. They staff wear a maid style uniform, but
        they operate like a normal cafe, with a daily special and
        occasional collaborations. Their prices are reasonable and they
        don't have an entrance fee.<br>

      <h3>Kanda Myojin Shrine</h3>
      <p>This is a very large Shinto shrine near Akihabara with lots of
        events going on throughout the year. They have a gift shop with
        souvenirs and even snacks.&nbsp; There are areas where people have
        hung up <i>ema</i> prayer board with their wishes on them, and
        since it's near Akihabara, they often have artistic manga-style
        illustrations added.<br>

        well known with tourists lately, so it might be crowded at times.<br>

      <h3>Creepy Vending Machine Corner</h3>
      <p>In Kanda Sudacho, near the old Niku-no-Mansei building, is an old
        building with a lot of very strange vending machines in it. It also has
        a lot of signs posted with strange messages, including various
        warnings against people who litter or vandalize the
        location.&nbsp; In the old days the building still had a sign
        reading "Takumi Lining Shop", so it was clearly once part of the
        button and lining district in that area. In addition to an odd
        variety of items in the vending machines, there are also
        "emergency food kits" wrapped in paper with odd, disturbing short
        stories printed on the outside.&nbsp; Be aware that if you buy
        these, you're buying the stories, as the items on the inside are
        generally just cheap snacks.&nbsp; This is more of a place to go
        to contemplate the mystery than to do a lot of shopping. But some
        of the unique items would make interesting souvenirs.<br>

      <h3>Walk along Chuo-Dori</h3>
      <p>This is the main street running north-south in the Akihabara
        area.&nbsp; Along this route are numerous restaurants, cafes,
        retail shops, souvenir shops, etc.&nbsp; You'll see lots of people
        dressed up and handing out fliers or holding up placards
        encouraging people to visit bars and restaurants - but be cautions
        about any place that uses touts to get customers.&nbsp; On Sundays
        the section of the Chuo-Dori in Akihabara closes to vehicle
        traffic to allow full access to pedestrians.&nbsp; But, be sure to
        get off the main street and explore the side streets as well.<br>

      <h3>Maid Reflexology (Cutie Relax)</h3>
      <p>After walking around Tokyo for a while you may have sore feet or
        a sore back.&nbsp; There are various massage and reflexology
        places in the are, but the one I recommend is Cutie Relax, which I
        have been to several times now.&nbsp; There are also a few places
        that present a less wholesome aesthetic, so do some research before going 
        into a random massage or reflexology shop.<br>

      <h3>Maid Road</h3>
      <p>A road running parallel to the Chuo-Dori to the west, with more
        pedestrian traffic than vehicles. You can often see many girls in
        maid outfits (and other cosplay) advertising their shops. There
        are also many popular retail shops along this road, such as
        Kotobukiya, Akibaoo, MaiDreamin, Super Potato, and the Akiba
        Cultures Zone Building.<br>

        are multiple floors of electronics, accessories, and stationary
        products.&nbsp; On the 8th floor there are a veriety of restaurants,
        and on the 9th floor is a golf driving range.&nbsp; It seems like no matter

      <h3>Live Street Performers<br>
      </h3>
      <p>The heyday of live street performers in Akihabara was the mid
        2000s, where you could find both amateur musicians and known
        performers of anime and game music performing their songs in front of
        Yodobashi Camera near Akihabara station. Eventually they cracked
        down on street performances in the Akihabara area.&nbsp; But you
        might still come across some live performers near the station in
        the evenings.<br>

      <p>On weekend evenings you can usually find highly decorated cars

        character goods on the inside. These are called 痛車 (<i>itasha)</i>,
        literally "pain car", or maybe, "cringe car". It's
        fun to see how many you can find and photograph.<br>

        shopping district of Akihabara. In fact the sign on the shop, 
        御生菓子 繁栄堂 (<i>Onamagashi Haneido</i>) means "Fresh sweets - Haneido", 
        from the early days
        when it produced traditional Japanese confections. Open just for
        lunch on weekdays, a limited number of bento boxes are produced

        While not as big and well know as other <i>moe</i> style cafes
        like At-Home and Maidreamin, it still has its charm and is tourist
        friendly. It has an admission charge of 600 yen, which is much
        more reasonable than the "girl's bar" style maid cafe &amp; bar
        businesses. They actually have multiple locations in Akihabara.<br>

        There are lots of options for toppings and sides. You order via
        the vending machine at the front of the store. The ordering system
        has gotten even easier lately: you used to get a ticket that you
        took to the cook inside, but now the order goes directly to the
        kitchen so you just have to watch for your number.&nbsp; Customers
        help keep the place running smoothly by getting their own water,
        returning their dishes to the tray return, and wiping down their
        space with the damp cloths when they are finished.<br>

      <h3>Little TGV</h3>
      <p>A train-themed Cosplay Cafe and Izakaya with a model railway set
        and other train memorabilia. Their menu is more extensive and
        sophisticated than the usual maid cafe in the area.&nbsp;
        Additionally, the clientele seems to be a bit different, with more
        older customers, and more families with children.&nbsp; This is
        one of the older, more established theme cafes in Akihabara -
        their blog page has entries dating back to 2009.<br>

      <h3>Tougenkyou (Tōgenkyō)<br>
      </h3>
      <p>This charming maid cafe has freshly made entrees, desserts, and
        beverages with a specials menu that changes daily. Unlike many
        maid cafes, there does not seem to be an entry charge; just a one
        drink order requirement. Another thing that makes this shop unique
        is that it is &quot;doll-friendly&quot;. Ball-jointed doll collectors visit
        with their dolls, and they even have "doll-sized" desserts that
        you can order.<br>

      <h3>Quiet stroll around Akihabara at night<br>
      </h3>
      <p>Even though Akihabara is bustling area for shopping, business,
        and tourism, at night it can be fairly quiet compared to areas of
        Tokyo associated with night life. Most of the retail
        establishments will close around 8:00 pm, so most of the shoppers
        will be gone by that time.&nbsp; When the last train leaves the
        station around midnight the area becomes even quieter, since there
        are only a few late night bars that are open between midnight and
        5:00am when trains start up again.<br>

      <p>Lunch Pack Sandwiches are like Uncrustables, but in a wide
        variety of sweet and savory options. There used to be a
        specialized Lunch Pack Sandwich shop in the Tsukuba Express
        Akibara Station, but that has closed.&nbsp; They are still
        available, along with other packaged sandwiches, at Daily Yamazaki
        locations. Some of the varietes I've tried are standard selections,
        like egg, tuna, sausage, ham, and tomato &amp; cheese;
        Japanese-style varieties like menchi katsu, sukiyaki style, and
        spaghetti Napolitan; and descriptively named special editions like
        Loaded! Sauce Yakisoba, Aoyama Gakuin University Style Curry, and
        Yu Lin Chi fried chicken.<br>

        probably due to a change in local ordinances. Also with the
        fliers, you can check out the places online before you go, to see

      <h3>Downtime in your hotel</h3>
      <p>If your hotel is Akihabara or not, don't overdo it, and take some
        downtime. Get a bento or snacks at a convenience store and relax
        in your room. Take that opportunity to catch up on laundry (if
        your hotel has a laundry room).&nbsp; Check social media for
        various events that might be taking place in Akihabara.<br>
